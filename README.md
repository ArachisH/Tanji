# Tanji 
Application built to sniff/manipulate the encrypted traffic between the Habbo client, and the server. Offering a variety of built-in tools for injecting and filtering data as well as an (so far undocumented) API for developers to create modules/extensions for the masses which are simplifying a task or bringing your own features.
